# Multi-Bootloader
Great way to put the Optiboot bootloader into several handy Atmel chips.

The Arduino system provides a way to use existing Arduino devices to make an ISP bootloader burner.

After doing it the 'old fashon way' using just a nano on a protoboard and a few jumpers, I decided to get a board make that was prewired for several chips with Zif sockets.
